# DevOps tasks


## Task 1
In the zip file new_tasks.zip you can find several tasks that are given to front-end candidates.
Your job is to do your best to create tests that would check if candidates followed the instructions.
Your tests should cover as much possible the sections "Definition of Done" and "You will fail".
Lack of information in the task description is intentional.
You are free to use any tools you need, however, the only acceptable language is JS.


Example:


## Task5 front-end requirements


### You will fail
* if you use anything else apart what is in the index.html file (nothing more than Bootstrap)


Possible solution:
* Create a nodeJS script that checks if the folder contains anything besides the index.html file


## Task 2
Create a Node app from Task3, package it as Docker. Put nginx in front of it; must be its own image.
Bonus - make additional route /admin and protect it from nginx.




### You will fail
* If you don't package your solution with Docker, if you don't combine containers


## Task 3
Create a IIS (config file) with common security headers, and find a way to inject GTM script through IIS.


### You will fail
* If you don't include at least Strict Transport Security, X-Powered-By and Content-Type Option headers.
* For the GTM part, we are more interested in your approach to solving this, but you will fail if you don't
  propose any solution.
