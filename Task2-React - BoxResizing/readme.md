# Box Resizing

## Description
Make React component which contains following:
* *div* with default values:
	* width: 300px
	* height: 300px
	* color: 'green'
 * 2 sliders (input), one for width and one for height
 * 2 number input boxes, one for width and one for height

Use **create-react-app** (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)


## Definition of done
* Number inputs accept only numerical values, in range 1 to 500
* Sliders have also range 1 to 500
* Changing sliders position reflects number inputs (if you move *height* slider to position 45, input for height has also value 45
* Changing numbers in input fields reflects slider positions 
* Changing both sliders and input values reflects the actual size of the green div

## You will fail
* if you use any other library besides React
